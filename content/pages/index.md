    content: >
      I am pursuing Integrated Masters of Technology in Mathematics and
      Computing at [Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines)
      Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/). My prime area of research interest is
      in Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning in
      general. I have previously worked on Sarcasm Detection in conversational
      settings, which led to the publication of my first research paper.
      Currently, I am interested in working on methods that can help in the
      interpretability of large language models for various NLP tasks. I am also
      interested in NLP methods that deal with multilingual data, especially in
      the Indian context. I intend to use my knowledge and experience of working
      on various projects to build products that can positively impact the lives
      of people in their day-to-day activities.
